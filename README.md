# My Resume with React Plus Rails!

After working through my resume and portfolio site based on just React as a simple single page app, I knew I could still improve it technology wise. With a giant list of json files sitting in the src folder of my app, I automatically knew that a REST API would be exactly what the doctor ordered. Having heard a ton about Ruby on Rails and not having a lot of experience with Ruby itself, this seemed like a great opportunity to brush up on Ruby and play with a new backend framework! From that little idea, I ended up learning a ton more than I expected from git submodules to rails routing and react proxying.

## Incoming Improvements

- Create a Swagger UI inspired routes list view
- Constrain/Restrict certain routes to only authorized users
